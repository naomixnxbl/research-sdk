"""Visibility Graph + Dijkstra path planner.

Origin
------
This is a fresh implementation, from two sources:

1. **Warthog Robotics' 2025 SSL TDP**: "treating each object in the field
   as a polygon. For each of its vertices, the visibility towards every
   other vertex is calculated and an edge is added between them if they are
   visible to each other," with "every polygon carr[ying] a Minkowski Sum
   considering the radius of a robot," searched with "an algorithm such as
   Dijkstra's." Warthog cites de Berg et al., *Computational Geometry:
   Algorithms and Applications* (2008) as the algorithm's origin.
2. That same de Berg et al. textbook, for the parts Warthog's TDP doesn't
   spell out (how start/goal splice into the graph) -- see `docs/algorithms.md`.

Why this isn't a plain polygon-edge test
-----------------------------------------
SSL obstacles are robots, i.e. circles. An earlier version of this module
followed Warthog's "treat each object as a polygon" description literally:
inflate each circle into a regular N-gon, then test every candidate edge
against that polygon's *edges*. A straight-edged polygon can't equal a
circle, so that design was always forced to pick one of two flaws:

- **Circumscribed** (safe for edge-blocking, since it never cuts inside the
  circle) -- but its corners reach past the true clearance circle, which
  false-rejected valid start/goal points landing in a corner's gap.
- **Inscribed** (accurate for containment) -- but its edges cut inside the
  true clearance, letting a path graze closer to an obstacle than intended.

No single polygon gets both right, because the obstacle isn't really a
polygon at all -- it's a circle.

The fix: check against the real circle
----------------------------------------
This version drops the polygon-edge test and checks every candidate edge
against the exact circle instead (point/segment-to-centre distance vs. the
true clearance radius, via `_dist_point_to_segment`). That settles both
concerns exactly, with zero approximation error:

- **Containment** ("is this point inside the obstacle?")
- **Edge-blocking** ("does this segment cross the obstacle?")

It's simpler too -- no segment-intersection code, no separate broad-phase
pass, since the exact test is already O(1) per obstacle.

One polygon still remains: waypoint placement
-----------------------------------------------
A regular N-gon is still used, but only to decide *where the candidate
waypoints go* (Warthog's "treat each object as a polygon" idea, applied
just to node placement). It's still circumscribed slightly outside the true
clearance circle -- not for the old reason, but because a hop between two
*adjacent* waypoints of the same obstacle is a chord of that obstacle's
circle, and any chord passes strictly inside its circle except at its own
endpoints. Waypoints placed exactly on the true circle would make every
boundary-hugging hop cut a little inside the real clearance. Circumscribing
them (`radius / cos(pi / sides)`, same formula as before) makes that chord
exactly tangent to the true circle instead, at essentially no extra detour.

Containment checks never look at this polygon -- they compare straight-line
distance to the true clearance radius directly -- so this can't reintroduce
the corner-gap bug that motivated the rewrite.

Performance note
-----------------
The first working version of this module used numpy arrays for every point
in the O(n^2) visibility test -- correct, but a real mistake: numpy's
per-call overhead on 2-element arrays dominates at these sizes, and a 5-8
obstacle scenario (roughly 100 polygon vertices, ~5000 candidate pairs)
took up to *19 seconds* in testing, several thousand times over the SSL
16ms budget. This version keeps the fix: plain Python floats/tuples for the
hot inner loop (numpy stays only for the one-time polygon generation, which
isn't in the O(n^2) path). Rerun `scripts/demo_planners.py` if you change
this file to make sure it stays fast.
